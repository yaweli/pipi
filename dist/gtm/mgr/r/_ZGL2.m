	W !,"^NAME(LEVEL1,LEVEL2 etc."
	W !,"NAME may be a single global name, from global-to global, global* to"
	W !,"     get all globals whose names start with something, or * for all globals"
	W !,"Each LEVEL is of the form FROM:THROUGH:CONDITION"
	W !,"FROM is an expression whose value indicates where to start nexting."
	W !,"THROUGH is an expression whose value indicates where to stop nexting."
	W !,"CONDITION is an expression to be evaluated by an if indirect"
	W !,"          to indicate whether or not to reject or accept a node."
